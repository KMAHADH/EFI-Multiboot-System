# EFI-Multiboot-System
OS multi-boot system for EFI based machines:

A system that uses the flexibility of the GRUB bootloader and UEFI standard to allow one to keep and and boot multiple installed Operating Systems from a single USB based storage drive/disk.

The goal is to combine not only systems that share the same kernel. We want one medium, that can boot Linux, Windows and BSD Operating systems.
